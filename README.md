**Hi there!  I'm Aditya**

I'm a passionate coder and computer science student who loves space and technology! 
I enjoy working with Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Batch — always exploring and building new things. 
Coding inspires me to create and learn more every day. 

Let's connect and grow together!
